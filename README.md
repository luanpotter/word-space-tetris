# word_space_tetris

Instead of blocks, letters fall from a spaceship. Move this letters left and right tap either sides of your phone and wait for then to reach the bottom. Form words in the grid and they disappear. But be careful: you must eliminate tiles because if they reach the top, you lose!

This is Open and Beta, and it's not finished! We haven't even added the spaceship yet! But you can already play, and, hopefully, have fun!
