# Credits

Thanks a lot for everyone that help! This could not have been done without the collaboration of the community.

Specially, thanks to:

* Erick (https://github.com/erickzanardo), for the original idea
* Anne (find her!), for the entire creation, ideation, game design, level design, artwork and motivation for this.
* Luan (https://github.com/luanpotter), for the implementation
* People from the hackathon (Carujo, et al.), for helping!

Also, we used the following resources:

* pt-BR word list: https://github.com/pythonprobr/palavras
* en-US word list: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

Thanks!
